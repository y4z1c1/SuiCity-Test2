            Start the game with four key structuresâ€” the Office, Factory, House,
            and Entertainment Complexâ€” as part of your SuiCity NFT, and take
            full advantage of dynamic NFT (dNFT) technology. Each building plays
            a unique role in shaping your city's growth and strategy, and as you
            progress, these structures will evolve both in appearance and
            functionality. With dNFT technology, every upgrade will be reflected
            in real-time, enhancing not only your cityâ€™s aesthetics but also its
            performance and value within the game.
