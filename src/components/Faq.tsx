          <h2>How do I start playing SuiCityP2E? </h2>
          <p>
            To start playing SuiCityP2E, you first need to freemint your SuiCity
            NFT. This NFT represents your city and includes four buildings:
            Entertainment Complex, Factory, House, and Office. All buildings
            start at level 0. Once you have minted your NFT, you can begin
            upgrading your buildings using. Upgrades will improve various
            aspects of your city, including increasing your passive income and
            enhancing the visual appearance and rarity of your CityNFT.

          <h2>How do I start playing?</h2>
          <p>
            You can start playing by freeminting a non-tradeable NFT, which
            serves as the foundation for your city. The NFT includes four main
            buildings—Entertainment, Factory, House, and Office—each starting at
            level 0.

          <h2>What is $SITY and how can I earn it?</h2>
          <p>
            $SITY is the native token of SuiCityP2E and is fully
            community-owned. It can be earned through various in-game
            activities, such as collecting daily factory revenue and earning
            passive income based on the level of your Office. Players can also
            earn $SITY through social media and Zealy tasks, art, and content
            creation events. Additionally, early community members, test
            players, and active Sui users may receive $SITY airdrops. The goal
            is to accumulate as much $SITY as possible before it gets listed.

          <h2>How does the Play2Airdrop model work?</h2>
          <p>
            The Play2Airdrop model in SuiCityP2E allows players to earn $SITY
            tokens by participating in the game. As players engage with the
            game, upgrade their buildings, and complete various in-game tasks,
            they earn $SITY tokens, which can later be used for further upgrades
            or exchanged once the token is listed on exchanges. The model
            rewards active participation, encouraging players to contribute to
            the game's ecosystem.

          <h2>How can I upgrade my buildings?</h2>
          <p>
            Buildings in SuiCityP2E can be upgraded using $SITY or $SUI tokens.
            Each building—Office, Factory, House, and Entertainment
            Complex—affects different aspects of the game. Upgrading these
            buildings enhances their functionality, such as increasing passive
            income, extending claim intervals, or boosting daily production
            revenue. Additionally, upgrades also improve the visual appearance,
            metadata, and rarity of your CityNFT, thanks to the use of dynamic
            NFTs.
